Node Js is an open source and cross platform js runtime to run js outside from web browser
It is used to build web/window/console application , web apis and hybrid applications
Node Js is build on chrome v8 engine 
Node Js is async and event driven js runtime to build for scalable network apps 
NodeJs based applications 
        WebApps
        Hybrid Apps(mobile,desktop)
        We can create APIs 
        Streaming services for audio and video 

Node based web servers
        Netflix
        LinkedIn
        Uber
        Paypal
        NASA

Node Js based desktop applications 
        VS Code
        Brackets
        atom 
        compass
        postman 
        Discord
Node Js Performance Secret 
        Js is single thread for execution 
        for time taking operations it uses async call back functions 


Event Loop - Js uses event loop to handle asynchronous operations 

Check after installing Node 
    open CMD 
            node -v
            npm --v 

we can also use pnpm , yarn instead of npm 

Create a js file in vs code , open terminal and run the file --> node filename

Node JS REPL:
------------
    Read
    Evaluate
    Print
    Loop 

to start repl - in terminal write -->  node and click enter

=============================================================================
Creating node app:

npm init   or    npm init -y  

give package name,version  , description , entry point (index.js) ,..enter 

we get package.json file  - it records important meta data of our application which is required
before publishing to npm and also defines , functional attributes that npm uses to identify entry point 

Lets see how to install a package 
npm i express 

uninstall a package 
npm uninstall express 

--------------------------------------
in frontend - we used console method to log messages to console 
in backend we have it as well 

--------------------------------------
String Substitution:

console.log('hi %s , how are you?', 'Apple');
output:  hi Apple , how are you?

console.log('this is %d and this is %d', 2, 3);
output:  this is 2 and this is 3

--------------------------------------
get file name 


console.log(__filename);//gives the complete path of file 
C:\WebDevelopment\FS\Tutor\Node\index.js

console.log(__dirname);//gives the folder path , in the file we are in 
C:\WebDevelopment\FS\Tutor\Node

--------------------------------------
process 

process - is an object , core module in node js that provides information about present current node js process 

console.log(process.version); //output:gives our nodejs version   v16.14.0

--------------------------------------

//global object
//global object in node js is same as window object in browser
console.log(console === global.console); //true

we can add  properties to global in node js
// global.name = 'Apple';
// console.log(name); //Apple
// console.log(global.name); //Apple

-----------------------------------------
create another file demo.js 
and write 
    global.name = "grapes";

now import this demo.js file into index.js file 
require('./demo');
console.log(name);//we can access the properties defined in other file into another file 
which were defined on the global object of node

-----------------------------------------
create commands in package.json

  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node index.js",
    "dev": "nodemon index.js"
  },


Add nodemon dependency
npm i nodemon -D 


we can now run using 
npm run dev
