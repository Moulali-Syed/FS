Linux

How we can run linux cli 

ubuntu is based on unix

REPL - read evaluate print loop

REPL - it reads and evaluates then prints and keep on running in loop 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: for any linux command you can check the usage and different
input flags it expects by running the command followed by --help 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#check the current working directory
        pwd

#print the directory content
        ls 
    listing of files

#change directory 
        cd dir_name

#go back by one folder level
        cd ..

#go two folders back    
        cd ../..

#go back to home directory
        cd ~

cd / ---> is root directory
cd ~ ---> home directory which is sub directory of root directory

#clear terminal
    clear 

#ls  with different flags 
        ls -l 

    this shows who is owner of file , permissions to files (read,write),date

        ls -a 
    this shows hidden folders as well 

        ls -lh
    works like ls -l , but also gives size of file 


#create a new folder
        mkdir dir_name 

#create a new file 
        touch filename.extension

        touch readme.md
    
#see content of file (prints the whole content of file)
        cat filename.txt

#remove a file 
        rm filename.txt

#remove a folder
        rmdir folder_name

#remove folder , when folder is not empty
        rmdir -r folder_name 

#forceful removal ** never use it
        rmdir -rf folder_name


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vim is a text editor 

#to create a new file or to open an existing file (if file doesnot exist it creates new file, if present it opens it)
vim filename.txt 
or
vi filename.txt 

esc+:q ---> to exit vim 


# by default when we open file using vi , it is in normal mode
using which we can navigate file 


#to write data to file  , we have to press i - this enters insert mode 

#after writing to a file , to keep our changes use the command to quit -->  esc+:wq 

#if file has some changes and we want to exit without saving -->  esc+:q!

#we can navigate file using arrow keys 

# we can also use to navigate file 
        l - right 
        h - left 
        k - top 
        j - bottom 


#in normal mode , if we press double d --> dd , this will delete the line 


#in normal mode , go to top of file --->  gg 

#in normal mode , go to last line of file  ---> G

#in normal mode , w ---> it can make u jump one word
#in normal mode , 2w ---> it can make u jump 2 words 
#in normal mode , d2w1 --> then this will delete 2 words 

#replace all 
    :%s/foo/bar -----> replace all occurences of foo with bar 

#copy and paste
 in normal mode -->  yw copies one word
 in normal mode -->  yy copies a whole line 
 in normal mode -->  p is used to paste 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tail filename.ext

tail -n 3 filename.ext

---

head filename.extension

head -n 3 filename.extension

----
echo "hello world"

----
echo "hi there" > demo.txt 

this will write hi there into the demo.txt file
