Type assertion:

as keyword(recommended)   or angle brackets syntax(not recommended)


function load(): any {}
let hello = load();

//u dont want to do this runtime type checks , instead we can use tell
if (typeof hello === 'string') {
  console.log(hello.trim());
}

//below is recommended way , which supports in JSX as well
console.log((hello as string).trim());

console.log(<string>hello.trim());
