Primitives in typescript:

These are same as in javascript
but here we mention them 



let isPresent: boolean = true;
let magic: number = 38;
let hello: string = 'Moulali';

let notdefined: undefined = undefined;
let notPresent: null = null;

let uniqueVal: symbol = Symbol('tomcat');
let bigNumber: bigint = 38n;


Typenames in typescript generally follows the pascal naming convention
The only type names that are lower case by default are these above Primitive datatypes 


Symbol  - is used to generate unique value
bigint - must have suffix n , used to store bigger numbers which are out of range of number
