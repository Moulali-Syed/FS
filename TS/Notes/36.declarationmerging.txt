typescript supports interface merging

a use case for that is using a node js framework like express

//say express has the below code defined in it 
export interface Request {
  body: any;
}

//we want to add something additional to it 
export interface Request {
  json: any;
}

//because of declaration merging supported by typescript interface 
//it is possible to merge them both and use as below
function handleRequest(req: Request) {
  req.body;
  req.json;
}



//type alias doesnot support , declaration merging
//then we must use the interface
