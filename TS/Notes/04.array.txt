Array is widely used in javascript, so as in typescript


let array: number[] = [1, 2, 3, 4];

let array2: Array<number> = [10, 11, 12, 13];

//we can declare array of any length
array = [1];

//we cannot assign value of other types , other than number , as we mentioned type
//if assigned a different value , we get a compilation error
// array = ['apple']; - Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'.

//we can declare array of fixed length - which in general programming terms called tuple
let tuple: [number, number] = [0, 0];

tuple = [1, 2];
tuple = [3, 8];

// tuple = ['chocos',1] - Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'number'
