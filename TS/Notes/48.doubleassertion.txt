point3 = point2; //Error

//with below ts compiler will trust us

//but sometimes it is not enough , then we can do double assertion
//as person and point3 has no similarity , we have to use double assertion
person = point3 as Person; //Error

person = point3 as unknown as Person; //this is double assertion , now ts will trust us
