The standard of accessing env variables with in node is using the process

//we can see that we are getting an error on process variable
//Cannot find name 'process'. Do you need to install type definitions for node? Try `npm i --save-dev @types/node`
//process is not defined anywhere in our code base and we expect node js to provide us
console.log('Logged in User: ' + process.env.USER);

//for this we can simply decalre a process variable of type any
//below is syntax of type declaration
//we cannot provide value for the declaration
// declare const process: any;

//we can create declarations in separate file as well
//these files has a extension of  .d.ts

//create a file env.d.ts and create the declaration
// declare const process: any;

//we can declare by ourself, but there is a more better way

//remove the env.d.ts file and try to compile the code
//it provides us with a suggestion
//npm i --save-dev @types/node

//now install it
//npm i @types/node

//then compile ur code , then no errors will be there

//we can use the node js built in modules
import fs from 'fs';
fs.writeFileSync('hello.txt', 'hi there');

//lets talk about 3rd party packages
//install express
//npm i express
//this needs external type declarations
//so install types
//npm i @types/express
