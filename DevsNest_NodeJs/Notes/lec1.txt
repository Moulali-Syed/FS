Introduction to Backend development:
-----------------------------------
In web dev we have FrontEnd and BackEnd 

Frontend mostly resides in browser
    we have html , css , js 
    to make our life easier we have react.js library
These are set of instructions , what to be displayed in browser 

Backend  - Node Js , python , Java , GoLang , PHP , Ruby (Any one of these is OK)
        BackEnd has servers , as we have browsers in Frontend 

        we tell browser what to do , like receive chat send chat , do calculation

        Backend has severs and databases 

What is Server?
Server is something which serves , we can say they are computers without screen 

Can our laptop can becomes a server ?
Yes , any device can become a server the only condition is it has to serve 

Can we access any laptop , No we have to make it publicly available then we can access the files 
we are okay to share 


What are databases?
data and bases --> the place /base where data resides is called a database 
data examples  - chat , file , password, identity , video, image .. all this is data 


If we have all the data in databases then why do we need servers?
The purpose of server is serve the data , database is to store the data 

For any website , we have a index.html , say iam opening google.com 
the browser requests for index.html to serve the index.html , then it ask database 
and give it back to server and server will again send it back to browser 


via internet we are able to communicate 
browser understands html , server understands node js , database understands its own query language
what would internet understands ?
language of INTERNET is called API 

we make an api call get data or to send data 

API - Application Programming Interface 

Any language is just a set of rules , that helps us and computer to do something 


Jargons of Backend:
APIs
databases
server 


Programming is just a set of rules to tell our computer what to do 

With evolution , we got many languages developed all are deep down Binary representations only 
C , C++ , Java , Python , Javascript  - all these solves a different problem 



Say in Youtube , 1 million users are watching the same live stream ,how can we serve this ?
    there can multiple solutions
                say 1 server (can handle 10 users)+ server +server +........
                or
                tell user to download desktop app - access the live cameras 
                or
                1 server that can serve 5 crore users 

    Similar way , different technologies handles this in a different way 

In Javascript we have event loop    
        What it does is , it created a Queue and divided our video into small parts

Javascript is single threaded , under the hood it has capability to handle 1 million users 

Along with the advantage of Event Loop , it has advantages as easy , huge developer community and write less code 

Thus javascript is came to backend and called it Node JS 

For any application that has a good traffic , we use Node JS


If we need low level coding , then we can use C , C++

--------
install node version manager 

nvm -v [to check nvm version]

to install latest nvm --> nvm install latest

to switch the version
nvm use vX.Y.Z



C:\Users\MOULALI>nvm use v18
Now using node v18.16.1 (64-bit)
